Vidor Recovery Instructions
---------------------------

1) Download VidorFPGARecovery archive and extract it.

2) Open the Command Prompt (run cmd.exe or run Command Prompt from the start menu)

3) Change directory to the VidorFPGARecovery folder (where the archive is extracted) with the command:

cd C:\path\to\VidorFPGARecovery

The path can be easily determined by drag and dropping the VidorFPGAFolder inside the command prompt window, this action will enter the complete path of the folder for you automatically. So, briefly, just type "cd " and drag&drop the VidorFPGAFolder inside the command prompt window.

4) Plug MKR Vidor 4000 in and double-tap reset button quickly

5) Determine the COM port of the MKR Vidor 4000, you will need to replace the <PORT> value in the commands below.
You can use the Arduino IDE "Tools" -> "Port" menu to determine the port number. For, example if it's COM6 replace <PORT> with COM6

6) Run:

tools\windows\bossac.exe -i -d -I -U true -i -e -w -v clujtag-server.ino.bin -R --port=<PORT>

7) Run:

tools\windows\clujtag.exe -p <PORT> -s boot.svf

NOTE: the COM port may change from the previous step.
NOTE: it will take almost a minute, please wait until the command completes before doing the next step
